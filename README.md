# React-Project

####Goal

Being new to React, I figured a tutorial would be good to get my feet wet before my bootcamp got into it. 

This is not a finished product.

###Setup

- Pull down the project files
- In the root folder `React-Project`, run `npm install` for all dependencies
- In the root folder `React-Project`, run `node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server` to start the webpack dev server
- Application will be served to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`
